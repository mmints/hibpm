# hibpm
Prototype for removing inconsistency in declare model via remainders.

## Meeting Log 
Here we're writing down some notes during meeting.

### April 8th:
- [Java Automata Library](https://www.brics.dk/automaton/)
- Carl Coras Repo for BPMN parsing: [inconsistencylibrary](https://gitlab.uni-koblenz.de/fg-bks/inconsistencylibrary)
- The only thing that we need are the test cases and maybe the parser.
